OSX-Post-Install-Script

*Setup script for OS X El Capitan.*

When run it installs command line programs and applications intended to bring the system up to speed in a fraction of the usual time required.

Running these scripts without proper understanding of what they do is strongly discouraged. No responsibility taken if you bork your system.
